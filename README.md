<h1>World-DB-Spring-REST</h1>
World-DB-Spring 'Stranger Strings' consisting of Murad, Alex, Oliver, Imogen, Patrick, Irina and Daniell ðŸ‘‹.

## Project Overview
This project creates a Java application that uses an SQL database which contains a list of countries and cities, along with other details.
This application allows users to query certain fields within the database, while following the spring architecture layout: Entities->Repository->Service->Controller
We implement RestAPIs and endpoints to allow the following CRUD methods.

- GET /web/cities/add-city: Adds a new city.
- GET /web/cities: Retrieves all cities.
- GET /web/cities/{id}: Retrieves a city by its ID.
- GET /web/cities/update/{id}: Updates an existing city.
- GET /web/cities/delete/{id}: Deletes a city by its ID.
- The above is similar for the countries and countrylanguage controller

## Acceptance Criteria
- Interact with the MySQL World Database
- Use Spring JPA to connect and communicate with the Database
- Use basic CRUD operations
- Provide multiple types of search methods
- Implement the service layer in the application
- Tested with WebMVCTests
- Secure endpoints wiht an API
- Error handling of API endpoints
- Front end website to interact with World Database
